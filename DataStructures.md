# Data Structure

## Array
* An array is a collection of elements stored at **contiguous memory locations**, where each element is accessed by an index.
* Fast access using index: `O(1)` time
* Use cases
  * Storing a list of items
  * ***Efficient lookups*** and iteration

## LinkedList
* A linkedList is a **linear data structure** where each element(node) contains: 
  * The data
  * A pointer to the next node in the sequence
* Unlikely arrays, elements are not stored in contiguous memory
* Access time: `O(n)` time
