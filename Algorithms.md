# Algorithms

## BFS
* Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching a graph or tree level by level.
  * It explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
* Data structure: **Queue**

## DFS
* DFS is an algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
  * ðŸ§  Think of it as: "Go deep before you go wide!"
* It can be implemented recursively(via call stack) or iteratively(using an explicit stack)
* Data structure: **Stack**
